# MLB_Highlights
A python program that shows MLB highlights for a chosen date.

A program I wrote to learn JSON and XML scraping as well as PyQT5. The MLB Gameday site is a good place to do this. 

This program will take the chosen date and search the website for games. Returns a list of games which can then be 
double-clicked to show the available highlights. Highlights should be in order. User can click and watch invididual
replays, or use a radio button to play them all. 

Bugs: Certainly.
